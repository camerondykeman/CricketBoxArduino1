##What is CricketBox?

CricketBox is a set of instructions for operating an Arduino-based climate controlled habitat.


##Why are you working on this?

Current animal agricultural practices are unsustainable and unethical. However, the human population's protein requirements are set to double by 2050.  
Crickets are a growing favourite among meat-substitutes and offers a real business opportunity.  
First we have to raise the crickets - this will provide a suitable habitat.
